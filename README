== Silvius-yakm

Silvius-yakm is an open source system for controlling Linux by voice.
This version uses https://github.com/thomasrebele/yakm to process the commands.

Quick start instructions:
- First, adapt the path to yakm_voice.py in run.sh
- Try ./run.sh -t to test speech recognition (it will ask which mic to use).
- Use ./run.sh -e to execute results on your local machine.
- If you are getting spurious recognitions, try ./run.sh -G to see the
  level of sound that forms background noise, and filter it out with
  ./run.sh -e -g 100.
